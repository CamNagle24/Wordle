## Setup

If you want to play around with Bitwise Puzzle, feel free to clone my repo. To start, please enter the following commands on your terminal:

```
git clone https://github.com/CamNagle24/Wordle
python3 ./wordle.py
#OR
python3 ./easy_wordle.py
```

You can edit the word "WORDY" with whatever you want your secret word to be at the bottom of each file.

Then the game will start as such below

```
> GUESS
```
And you can play the game as normal from there! (Only 5 letter words)
